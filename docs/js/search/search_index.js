install this library, run:\n$ npm install --save ngx-segment-analyticsConsuming Segment\nAdd the SegmentModule to your Angular AppModule:\nimport { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';\nimport { NgModule } from '@angular/core';\n\nimport { AppComponent } from './app.component';\n\n// Import the Segment module\nimport { SegmentModule } from

'YOUR_WRITE_APIKEY', debug: true, loadOnInitialization: true })\n  ],\n  providers: [],\n  bootstrap: [AppComponent]\n})\nexport class AppModule { }You can use the SegmentService in any constructor as a injected service :\nimport { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';\nimport { SegmentService } from 'ngx-segment-analytics';\n@Component({\n    selector: 'hero',\n    templateUrl:
